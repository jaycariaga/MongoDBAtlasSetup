# MongoDBAtlasSetup
very quick code to setup atlas onto node server
<h2>Necessary installations</h2>
1. Install Node.js and MongoDB
<br />
2. After cloning project, install npm packages and dependencies in the terminal. For example, mongodb is "npm install mongodb"
<br />
3. Create an Atlas account and follow instructions on how to create a cluster (free trial). <b>Link: https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/connectionstring/ </b>
<br />
4. In the code, remember to replace the <...> parameters with your cluster's user configurations!

<h2>Quick Note</h2>
There is no useful code here besides testing out the functionality of Mongo Atlas' connectivity.  
Although, it is easily customizable with api's using the Express javascript dependency.
